This project explores survival patterns from the Titanic disaster using the Titanic dataset. It focuses on applying statistical analysis and machine learning techniques in R to predict passenger survival outcomes. The project demonstrates my ability to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build classification models using real-world data.

Tools used
Programming Language: R

Libraries Used: ggplot2, dplyr, caret, e1071

Methods: Data preprocessing, logistic regression, decision trees, model evaluation

Techniques: EDA, feature engineering, classification, model evaluation with confusion matrix and ROC

Process Breakdown
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values in columns such as Age and Cabin

Converted categorical variables into factors (e.g., Sex, Embarked, Pclass)

Normalized continuous features to improve model learning

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized survival distributions using ggplot2 (bar plots, histograms, boxplots)

Identified key factors influencing survival: Gender, Passenger Class, and Fare

Analyzed correlations and outliers to guide feature selection

3. Model Building
Created a Logistic Regression model to predict survival with training and test split

Trained a Decision Tree classifier using rpart for comparison

Tuned models with cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization

4. Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualized results using a confusion matrix and an ROC curve to assess classification performance
